# OASIS
Open-source BPLM Gamification framework

_This project is still under development_

Oasis, is a event-driven gamification framework where you can define the game rules for events
from you applications and let the players play on top of them.
There is no restriction in terms of which application you can use with this framework, as long as
you can generate events, which indicates key performance indicators (KPIs), from them.

In Oasis, the admin can define several gamification elements, such as, Points, Badges, Leaderboards,
Milestones, Challenges, and Races.

Players can accumulate points and badges for the events they correlated,
and will automatically compete in leaderboards, milestones and races.
Top competitors will be awarded more points in turn.
And also, earned points can be used to buy items for your playing hero and upgrade its abilities and compete
with whole other teams.

## Features:
  * Many different customizable gamification elements
  * Near real-time status updates
  * Character driven game playing
  * Supports teams and scopes
  * Highly customizable theme to the playing environment
  * Embeddable leaderboards and avatar widgets inside official apps
  * Cloud friendly

## Key Gamification Elements in Oasis

#### Points
A user can score points based on KPIs in the events. The point rules are pre-defined
before the gameplay. However can be added later as well when a new application is going to be integrated
or new events are ready to be generated.
Points are the primary element in Oasis and it drives many other elements too.

#### Badges
A badge is a collectible achievement by a user based on correlating one or several
events. Badges are again pre-defined before the gameplay. Set of users can form a team
and then teams can compete together.

#### Leaderboards
Admins or curators can define custom leaderboards on top of points. Leaderboards will always be scoped
to a fixed time-period.

#### Milestones
Milestone can be created to accumulate points forever to strengthen the players through long term
game playing. It indicates the progress gained by a user. Milestones can be broken down to
levels. And completion of each level will award bonus points to the users.

#### Challenges
Challenge can be created by a curator to motivate towards a very short term goal. Usually
a curator can create a challenge for a certain event to come first and once it received,
the user correlated with that event will be considered as a winner. Once a winner is declared,
the challenge is completed.

#### Races
Races are point-awarded leaderboards for tumbling time windows. At a pre defined time range
(daily, weekly, monthly), leaderboard winners will be awarded set of bonus points. This will
continue in each time window as specified in a race.

Why Oasis?

Ultimate objective of the Oasis is to increase the user engagement in working places
through a gamified environment. Oasis might help your organization to increase the productivity
and could help in creating a better place to work.

Following gamifiable environments have been identified.
   - SDLC: whole software development lifecycle (coding, bug fixing, deployments) using the
   application stack (Code Quality, CI/CD, ALM tools)
   - Support Systems: IT helpdesk systems
