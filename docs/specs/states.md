# States

* State is a status which a user can be in at any given time.
  * For eg: Question to answer ratio, Violation density
 
* Very similar to milestones but does not accumulate through history.
* External applications must send event(s) notifying the current state.
  * Based on state, user will be awarded points.
* The points awarded from state won't be part of Milestones or any other game elements.
  * State points are just a net points you awarded for being in that state.
