# Leaderboards

* Leaderboards are **_only_** defined from points.
* Leaderboards are defined against two dimensions.
    * Time range = daily / weekly / monthly / all time / custom ranges
    * Scope = team-wise, game-wise

**_Note_**: Oasis will not support global leaderboards where players can be compared across games.

## Tie-breakers

* When two users have same number of points, there is no guarantee that which player will come first.

## Examples

* Sample request and response from admin-api for a leaderboard data
